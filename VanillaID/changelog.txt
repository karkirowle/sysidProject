tac_reconstruction.m
After finding discrepancies between original paper and tac 
reconstruction code, there were some minor modifications done. (absolute value change)

simGraph.m
First part of RungeKutta simulation implemented. Derivative calculation is improved
by calculating the derivative with the analytical formula. 
TODO: Correct truncation of
resulting formula, because tac_reconstruction.m only accepts derivative which are
one element shorter than timeseries length
TODO: Checking RungeKutta simulation noise addition is right. It might need some changes due
to being a Wiener process.
TODO: Implementing geneGraph wrapper

geneGraph.m
Gene graph RungeKutta wrapper done
