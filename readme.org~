#+TITLE: Bayesian 


Identification of Gene Regulatory Networks

* Intro
  This document is a guide for the code in this directoriy which serves as the basis of my
Master's Thesis. All code was made during 2017 October to 2018 June, based on the VanillaID
system identification toolbox.

* File list
** Main folder

- changelog.txt :: I made a log on the changes in certain commits. It contains some information on what might be missing from the code, but it is not really helpful in my opinion.
- config.m :: A config file which adds the directories. All simulation runs are supposed to be run from the main folder.
- configserver.m :: A config file but for the server. The only difference is that it adds the CVX toolbox, because I found no other way to add the toolbox permanently from the server command line.
- dictionaryVisualisation.m :: Code for the visualisation of the dictionaries I've used in my thesis.
- eachSNR.mat :: A MAT which has combination of multiple runs.
- fisherAnimation.m :: A file which creates a GIF from the contents of a load file
- linearComparison.m :: preliminary code performing the oracle estimator lower bound calculations
- MAPdata.mat :: contains the combination of data used with MAP uncertainty sampling
- myColorMap.mat :: MAT file containing a colormap
- oracleLinear.mat :: a result of the linearComparison.m file
- Randomdata.mat :: contains results for randomised sampling
- serverprogressCheck.m :: checks progress of files on server
- serverprogress.mat :: auxiliary file for serverprogressCheck.m
- signalCorruption.m :: code used to noise derivative series
- sparseanimation3.gif :: animation generated by fisherAnimation.m
- tac_reconstruction.m :: Contains the actual code for the Sparse Bayesian Learning algorithm
- testSNR.m ::
- totalSNR.mat :: Another combination file with the Fisher Information metric
- trialRun.mat ::

** checkpoints 
A directory containing checkpoints for the simulations made on the server

** draft
Old code, which are mainly related to the "consistency problem", which we switched from after the first half year.
** draft2
A second set of old code folder which contains useful code, but it is unrelated to the final results in the thesis.
** errorModel 

- experimentMerge.m :: merge the experiments from multiple mat files
- experimentMergeRandom.m :: exact replica of the first one with different filenames, just for convenience reasons
- graphFactoryReport2.m :: file comparing random and MAP uncertainty sampling
- graphFactoryReport.m :: file producing all the graphs in the thesis
- oracleCalculator.m :: A little snippet for calculating the oracle estimator
- results :: This folder has all the figures which are in the thesis

** simulationFiles

- fisherBasesParallel.m :: Varying the amount of bases to give indication how well the algorithm performs
subset selection - parallalised
- fisherNoiseless.m :: a single noiseless simulation of the repressilator with Fisher information adding
- fisherRepParallel.m :: Fisher Information Based sampling PARALLEL
- fisherRepParallelPinv.m :: uses the pseudoInverse ordering
- fisherRepressilator.m :: Fisher Information Based sampling
- gammaRepParallel.m :: Gamma repressilator, which uses parallelised adaptive sampling
- maxFisherDictionaryBatch.m :: lambda normalised Fisher code
- maxFisherDictionary.m :: 
- maxGammaDictionary.m :: performs adaptive MAP based uncertainty sampoling
- maxRegDetDictionaryBatch.m :: performs MAP based uncertainty sampling
- maxTraceFisherDictionaryBatch.m :: used to pinv
- randomSamplingRepressilator.m :: samples randomly
